# hCard-Builder

A hCard Builder built using React/Redux, and styled with SASS.

Feel free to compile in your local environment, or download the working app from the 'compiled-app' folder.

or, hit up http://www.scottgangemi.com/hcard to see it up and running right now.

All up took about 6 - 6.5 hours to complete.

Note:

I unfortunately don't have a Windows machine to test on, so haven't been able to check what it looks like on IE10/IE11. Judging by my love of flexbox, some of the positioning might look a bit off on them, but the rest of the elements should look okay.
